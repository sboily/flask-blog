Microblog with flask
====================

This is a proof of concept to create a microblog in python, orchestrated by docker (docker-compose). Every components is a module loaded by stevedore. It's very easy to added new modules.

Inspired by the idea from https://github.com/dmaslov/flask-blog

Using bootstrap theme from https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog

Using with docker
=================

You need docker-compose.

    pip install docker-compose

And execute docker-compose

    docker-compose up
